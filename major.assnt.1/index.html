	<h2> Brief history</h2>

<p>The Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) are a professional basketball team based in Toronto, Ontario. 
After the Vancouver Grizzlies moved to Memphis in 2001, the Raptors became the only Canadian team in the NBA. 
Since its founding in 1995, the team has won six division titles, made the playoffs 11 times and won the NBA championship once. 
Star players have included Damon Stoudamire, Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Kyle Lowry, 
DeMar DeRozan and Kawhi Leonard. In 2017–18, the Raptors finished atop the Eastern Conference regular season 
standings and set a franchise record with 59 wins. They won another division title in 2018–19 and advanced to the NBA Finals, 
where they defeated the Golden State Warriors in six games for their first NBA championship in franchise history.</p>
